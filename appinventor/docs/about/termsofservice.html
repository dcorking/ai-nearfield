              <p>
                1.1. Your use of the App Inventor for Android (the "Service") is governed by this
                agreement (the "Terms"). "Google" means Google Inc., located at 1600 Amphitheatre
                Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates
                involved in providing the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                1.2. In order to use the Service, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree
                to the Terms by actually using the Service. You understand and agree that Google
                will treat your use of the Service as acceptance of the Terms from that point
                onwards.
              </p>
              <p>
                1.3. You may not use the Service if you are a person barred from receiving the
                Service under the laws of the United States or other countries including the
                country in which you are resident or from which you use the Service. You affirm
                that you are over the age of 13, as the Service is not intended for children under
                13.<br>

              <p>
                2.1. You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you
                register to use the Service. You are responsible for the security of your passwords
                and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of
                your password or of your account, you agree to notify Google immediately.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.2. Your use of the Service must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
                ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.
              </p>
              <p>
                2.3. You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the Service by any means
                other than through the interface that is provided by Google in connection with the
                Service, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement
                with Google, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the
                Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

                3. Service Policies and Privacy
              </h2>
              <p>
                3.1 The Service shall be subject to Google's privacy policy available at
                http://www.google.com/privacy.html. You agree to the use of your data in accordance

                4. Content in the Service and Take Down Obligations
              </h2>
              <p>
                4.1. You understand that all information (such as data files, written text,
                computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other
                images) to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the
                Service are the sole responsibility of the person from which such content
                originated. All such information, including the application that you create using
                the Service and any source code written by you to be used with the Service is
                referred to below as the "Application."
              </p>
              <p>
                4.2. Google reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to pre-screen,
                review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or remove any or all Applications from the
                Service. Google reserves the right to directly take down any Application that
                violates these Terms, any applicable Program Policies, or applicable law or
                regulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.3. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                responsibility to you or to any third party for) the Application that you create,
                transmit or display while using the Service and for the consequences of your
                actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.4. You agree that Google has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or
                failure to store your Application and other communications maintained or
                transmitted through use of the Service. You further acknowledge that you are solely
                responsible for securing and backing up your Application.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.5. You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has no
                responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your obligations
                under these Terms, any applicable third party contract or Terms of Service, or any
                applicable law or regulation, and for the consequences (including any loss or
                damage which Google or any third party may suffer) of any such breach.

                5. Proprietary Rights
              </h2>
              <p>
                5.1. You acknowledge and agree that Google (or Google's licensors) own all legal
                right, title and interest in and to the Service, including any intellectual
                property rights which subsist in the Service (whether those rights happen to be
                registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2. Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Google, nothing in the Terms
                gives you a right to use any of Google's trade names, trade marks, service marks,
                logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.3. Except as provided in Section 7, Google acknowledges and agrees that it
                obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under these Terms
                in or to any Application that you create, submit, post, transmit or display on, or
                through, the Service, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in
                that Application (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and wherever
                in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing
                with Google, you agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those
                rights and that Google has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

              <p>
                6.1. Google gives you a personal, limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable
                and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by Google as part of
                the Service as provided to you by Google (referred to as the "App Inventor for
                Android Programming Platform" below). This license is for the sole purpose of

                permitted by the Terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.2. You may not (and you may not permit anyone else to): (a) copy, modify, adapt,
                redistribute, decompile, create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, or
                otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the App Inventor for Android
                Programming Platform or any part thereof, unless this is expressly permitted or
                required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by
                Google, in writing (e.g., through an open source software license); (b) attempt to
                disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Service; (c) use the
                Service to create an Application that performs a malicious activity, including but
                not limited to spamming users, harvesting usernames and passwords, performing
                unauthorized scans of machines or ports; or (d) use the Service to create an
                Application that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized
                manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party,
                including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile communications carrier, or (e)
                upload or otherwise process any malicious content to or through the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.3. Unless Google has given you specific written permission to do so (e.g.,
                through an open source software license), you may not assign (or grant a
                sub-license of) your rights to use the App Inventor for Android Programming
                Platform, grant a security interest in or over your rights to use the App Inventor
                for Android Programming Platform, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to

              </p>
              <p>
                6.4. Components of the App Inventor for Android Programming Platform licensed under
                an open source software license are governed solely by the terms of that open
                source software license and not the Terms.<br>

                7.1. Google claims no ownership or control over any Application. You retain
                copyright and any other rights you already hold in the Application, and you are
                responsible for protecting those rights, as appropriate. By submitting, posting or
                displaying the Application on or through the Service you give Google a worldwide,
                royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate,
                publish, perform, display and distribute the Application for the sole purpose of
                enabling Google to provide you with the Service, including&nbsp; storing the
                Application on its servers. Furthermore, by creating an Application through use of
                the Service, you give Google a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license
                to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, perform, display and distribute
                such Application for the sole purpose of enabling Google to provide you with the
                Service, including storing the Application on its servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                7.2. You agree that Google, in its sole discretion, may use the trade names,
                trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names and other distinctive brand features
                of your Application in presentations, marketing materials, customer lists,
                financial reports and Web site listings (including links to your website) for the
                purpose of advertising or publicizing your use of the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                7.3. If you create an Application to share with other users of the Service, you may
                determine with whom you share the Application and grant to such users a
                non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to perform, display, and use the
                Application.
              </p>

                8.1. The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from
                time to time from Google. These updates are designed to improve, enhance and
                further develop the Service and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced functions,
                new software modules and completely new versions. You agree to receive such updates
                (and permit Google to deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Service.
              </p>

              </h2>
              <p>
                9.1. Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible
                experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the
                Service which Google provides may change from time to time without prior notice to
                you.
              </p>
              <p>
                9.2. You may discontinue your use of the Service at any time. Google may, at any
                time, terminate your use of the Service and disable your access to the Service at

              </p>
              <p>
                9.3. When the Terms comes to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and
                liabilities that you and Google have benefited from, been subject to (or which have
                accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are expressed to
                continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of
                Section 16.7 shall continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities
                indefinitely.
              </p>

                9.4. Upon any termination of the Service under Section 9, these Terms will also
                terminate, but Sections 5.1, 10, 11, 12, and 16 shall continue to be effective
                after these Terms are terminated.

              <p>
                14.1. By virtue of the Terms, the parties may have access to information that is
                confidential to one another ("Confidential Information").&nbsp; “Confidential
                Information” means the specific terms of the Terms, the App Inventor for Android
                Programming Platform (including without limitation all object code and source
                code), and any information, data or other materials provided by one party to the
                other under or in connection with the Terms (other than information intended to be
                disclosed to third parties as set forth herein) that is (a) clearly and
                conspicuously marked as “confidential” or with a similar designation; (b) is
                identified by the disclosing party (“Discloser”) as confidential and/or proprietary
                before, during, or promptly after presentation or communication; or (c) is
                disclosed in a manner which the Discloser reasonably communicated, or the receiving
                party (“Recipient”) should reasonably have understood under the circumstances that
                the disclosure should be treated as confidential, whether or not the specific
                designation “confidential” or any similar designation is used.
              </p>
              <p>
                A party's Confidential Information shall not include information which: (a) is or
                becomes a part of the public domain through no act or omission of the other party;
                or (b) was in the other party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had
                not been obtained by the other party either directly or indirectly from the
                disclosing party; or (c) is lawfully disclosed to the other party by a third party
                without restriction on disclosure; or (d) the Recipient can adequately demonstrate
                was independently developed by the Recipient without use of or reference to the
                Discloser’s Confidential Information.&nbsp; You shall not disclose the results of
                benchmark tests or other evaluations of Android to any third party unless Google
                grants you prior written consent to such disclosure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The parties agree, both during the term of the Terms and for a period of three (3)
                years after termination of the Terms, to hold each other's Confidential Information
                in confidence and to protect the disclosed Confidential Information by using the
                same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the
                unauthorized use, dissemination or publication of the Confidential Information as
                they use to protect their own confidential information of a like nature.&nbsp; The
                parties agree not to make each other's Confidential Information available in any
                form to any third party or to use each other's Confidential Information for any
                purpose other than the implementation of the Terms. Each party agrees to take all
                reasonable steps to ensure that Confidential Information is not disclosed or
                distributed by its employees or agents in violation of the provisions of the Terms.

                15. Changes to the Terms
              </h2>
              <p>
                15.1. Google reserves the right to make changes to the Terms from time to time.
                When these changes are made, Google will make a new copy of the Terms available
                here.
              </p>
              <p>
                15.2. You understand and agree that if you use the Service after the date on which
                the Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as acceptance of the updated
                Terms.

              <h2>
                General Legal Terms
              </h2>
              <p>
                16.1. The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
                govern your use of the Service (but excluding any services which Google may provide
                to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace any prior
                agreements between you and Google in relation to the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.2. There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are
                independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency, partnership
                or joint venture.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.3. If Google provides you with a translation of the English language version of
                these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if there is
                any conflict.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.4. You agree that Google may provide you with notices, including those regarding
                changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Service.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.5. You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
                remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Google has the benefit of under
                any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Google's
                rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Google.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.6. Google shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its
                obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including
                but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood
                or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.7. The Terms, and your relationship with Google under the Terms, shall be
                governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
                laws provisions. You and Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
                the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any
                legal matter arising from the Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google
                shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of
                urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.
